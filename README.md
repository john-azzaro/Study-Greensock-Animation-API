## What is Greensock Animation API Study?
The "Greensock Animation API Study" is an exploration of the Greensock Animation API (GSAP).  GSAP is a very handy
animation library that helps you make preformant animations.  In this study, you have a simple landing page with a 
headline and an image.  Using GSAP, the image and headline use a simple animation to reveal on load.

<br>

## What libraries can you use with GSAP?
There are 4 libraries to choose from- TweenLite, TweenMax, TimelineLite, and TimelineMax.  TweenMax has more features than
TweenLite and TimlineMax has more features than TimelineLite.

## How do you install GSAP?
To install your desired GSAP libraries, which for all intents and purposes is TweenMax and TimelineMax, you simply need to 
include the scripts in your HTML file before your JavaScript file.
```HTML
      <script
         src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/2.1.3/TweenMax.min.js"

      ></script>
      <script
